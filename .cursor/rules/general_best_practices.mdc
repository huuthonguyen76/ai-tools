globs: **/*.py

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for formatting.
- Use docstrings to document functions and classes.
- Write simple and clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Prefer list comprehensions for creating lists when appropriate.
- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
- Utilize type hints for better code clarity and type checking.
- Limit the use of global variables to reduce side effects.
- Choose descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- When generating code, if the current type is list prefix variable name is: `l_<variable_name>`, if the current type is dict `d_<variable_name>`, if numpy `np_<variable_name>`.
